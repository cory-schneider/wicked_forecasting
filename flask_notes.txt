Setting the environment variable in PowerShell
$env:FLASK_APP = "flaskblog.py"



"If like me, you ended up wanting to play with the database after making all the changes that Corey did in this video and didn't know what to do, here is a working solution:

1) Make sure to activate the appropriate virtual environment to work with all needed packages.
2) Open a Python interpreter at the root of your project directory (in the same directory as run.py).
3) Execute the following code (without comments if you wish):

from flaskblog import create_app, db
app = create_app()
# context to run outside the application (no need to launch the server)
ctx = app.app_context()
ctx.push()  # start working on database after that command
# Database manipulations here
# ...
ctx.pop()  # exit from the app
exit()

This explanation comes from StackOverflow here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24060553/creating-a-database-outside-the-application-context

I am really loving this stuff! I cannot wait to get my first job!
